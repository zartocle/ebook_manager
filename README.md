### Ebook manager


This is a little educational project; a program that, once given a directory path, will scann all files contained in it and, for those that are ebooks, will parse file metadata and rename the file accordingly, based on the structure <book_name>_ <author_name>



It was developed using a virtual environment created with the `venv` package and is provided with a `requirements.txt` file that provides the list of python packages that are necessary to its execution


#### How to prepare the environment to execute the program:

* (Recommended:) Create a virtual environment with the tool of your choice

* Install the packages listed in `requirements.txt` with:

| pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
